                    We have a diverse team, highly skilled in varied thematic areas. Our consultants have led teams into 
                    accomplishing a wide range of complex projects that involve many professionally regulated stakeholder groups, by using collaborative, participatory and all-inclusive approaches.
                    Our experts have previous experience in working with International NGOs, local NGOs, Government Institutions, Universities, United Nations Agencies, Media Houses, among other recognized institutions. Along with strengths in oral and written communications, our team has strong analytical skills with both quantitative and qualitative expertise in the broad areas of research, measurement, learning and programming.

               <h2> What do we do differently? </h2> <br>
                At Vision Quest, we have established ourselves as a regional leader by offering our clients the following distinguished advantages:

                <br><h2> Our Access and Capacity </h2> <br>

                We have access to hard to reach areas in Eastern Africa that could be declared inaccessible due to insecurity, impassable roads and population movements. We rapidly mobilize our teams located inaccessible parts of Somalia, South Sudan and Northern Kenya on short notice. The teams deployed to our clients’ assignments benchmark with the best in their areas of expertise.

                <br> <h2> Our Networks and Relationships </h2> <br>

                We have invested heavily to initiate and nurture relationships among high-level government officials, civil society and other development partners in all the countries that we work in.  We offer these networks to our clients and mobilize their support for our client’s benefit. During our assignments, we call on these relationships to the advantage of the clients we are representing. With these functional networks and relationships, we have an assignment execution system that enables us to rapidly deploy field teams to gather field data with very short turnaround times.

                <br><h2> Our Experience </h2> <br>

                With our vast experience working in these countries, we know gaps, challenges and opportunities around policy, programming and cultural issues (such as environmental, conflict, resources, planning etc.) that affect and/or influence outcomes. We tap into our technical and cultural know how to provide tailor made services and products for our clients.

                <br> <h2> Our Approach </h2> <br>

                We recognize that the problems faced by our clients are not confined to certain sectors (e.g. health, security, education, nutrition or infrastructure only). With our Integrated Territory Management Department, we use an integrated approach using a systems thinking lens to enable generation of practical, inclusive and results producing insights in difficult and most often-complex program implementation gaps. Our work facilitates cross-sectorial partnerships and engagements by using conceptual and simulation models to generate cross-sectorial programmatic engagement.

                <br> <h2> Our Team </h2> <br>

                Our in-house team boasts of international experts with multi-country, multi-sector and multi-stakeholder experience. In all the areas we have worked in, we have a strong network of national consultants and experienced research assistants who are Vision Quest trained. Furthermore, we also maintain a global pool of experts whom we regularly call to support the needs of our clients.

                <br><h2> Our Innovations </h2><br>

                The ever changing implementation scope in terms of climate change, technological advances, emerging and re-emerging health, food security, WASH and conflict related issues amongst other factors, call for a rethink to traditional approaches to programming. Vision Quest is constantly exploring new solutions towards the challenges faced by humanitarian and development partners. In this regard, we have made significant progress in developing conceptual and simulation models to address challenges and gaps in current humanitarian and development work. As a rule of thumb, we use advanced technology in data collection and analysis for efficient, accurate and reliable data management processes.
